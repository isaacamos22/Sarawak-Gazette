THE Sarawak Gazette. PRICE KUCHING, Wednesday, April 1st, 1936. 20 CENTS. The Sarawak Gazette. WEDNESDAY. APRIL 1st. 1936. Death. At Kuching, Sarawak, Daniel Thomas Wynne James, age 59 years. Local and Personal. MARCH. His Highness the Rajah left for a visit to the North on March 30th, travelling by s.s. Darvel. His Highness, who proposes to visit Miri and Baram, expects to return to Kuching on April 11th. His Highness was accompanied by Dayang Valerie and Mrs. C. D. Adams, who arrived in Kuching from Sibu on the 27th. Dayang Valerie paid a short visit to Singapore during the month, leaving Kuching on March 7th and returning on the 16th. While in Singapore, Dayang Valerie was the guest of Air-Commodore and Mrs. S. W. Smith. His Highness the Rajah has very kindly presented a complete new set of instruments to the Kuching Military Band. His High ness� gift fulfils a long-felt, want, since a number of the former instruments were suffering from old age. Visitors to Kuching during March in cluded Mr. R. B. Willmot, H. M. Trade Commissioner, Singapore. Mr. Willmot, who passed through Kuching on his way North last month, was returning to Singapore after completing an extensive tour of British North Borneo. He left by the Vyner Brooks on March 25th. We note from the Engkilili report for Feb ruary that a Dayak Prisoner who escaped from Engkilili jail early one morning was peremptorily ordered hack to prison by his mother, whom he chanced to meet during his flight. He returned to duress the same afternoon. The moral of this little incident seems to be that aspiring prison-breakers should take care to avoid their near relations,�at any rate if they are Dayaks, who are notoriously susceptible to parental influence. The Rev. Father W. P. B. Shelly, C.R., returned to Kuching after a trip to Hong Kong on March 9th. His Highness the Rajah has kindly con sented to become the Patron of the Sarawak Badminton Association. A note regarding the formation of this association will be found on another page. Sport is booming in Kuching at the mom ent. Badminton courts are springing up in every kampong; Hockey which is a compar atively new development, is proving im mensely popular, and even �rugger�-is begin- ning to come into its own. A feature of this game is the increasing interest shown in it by Malays; under the tuition of a few Europeans enthusiasts there seems to be no reason why they should not eventually produce a very useful side. We may one day see a Rugby league in Kuching, and regular Rugby fixtures arc already well with- in the bounds of possibility. Formerly rugger matches were confined almost exclu- sively to Race Weeks, and the play was some times apt to he a trifle eccentric, to say the least of it. During the night of March 15th the General Post Office was broken into and a considerable quantity of registered mail stolen. Steps are being taken to render similar thefts impossible in the future. We record with deep regret the death of Mr. D. James, which took place at the General Hospital, Kuching, on March 21st. Mr. James, who was a noted research chemist, lived for many years at Goebilt. and had recently been working at Bau; his death, which was quite unexpected, came as a great shock to his numerous friends, both European and Asiatic. The funeral took place in the cemetery of St. Thomas� Pro-Cathedral on the after noon of the 21st. An appreciation of the late Mr. James will be found in another column. Mr. & Mrs. F. T. Merrill, who are on a round-the-world tour, arrived at Kuching on March 2nd. They left the following day for Sibu, where they hoped to see something of the Dayak life of the Rejang River. Mr. & Mrs. Merrill had recently made a prolonged stay in Bangkok after visiting India and Indo-China. Mr. H. B. Crocker, Acting Government Secretary, and Mr. C. D. Le Gros Clark. Secretary for Internal Affairs, paid a flying visit to Sibu during the month, arriving on March 10th and leaving the following day. Mr. A. Murray. Government Dentist, has been invalided from the Service owing to failing eyesight. We understand that he will be leaving Kuching early in April. It is becoming increasingly the custom, at any rate in Kuching, for brides at Malay weddings to be attired in European style, complete with orange-blossom, bridal veil, and bunch of lilies. Often enough, too. they are attended by flower-girls who act as train-bearers. One point in favour of this innovation is that it saves expense, the tradi tional finery being sometimes extremely costly. We are asked to state that a number of bound copies of Her Highness the Ranee�s play The Merry Matrons are available, price $1 and may be obtained on application to the Hon. Secretary. Kuching Amateur Dramatic Society. The proceeds of the sale of Her Highness� play are devoted to the assistance of the Society. A cricket team made up of Europeans from Kuching and Sibu is going to Miri at Easter, following an invitation from the Gymkhana Club. Miri. The last Kuching-Miri match was played nt Kuching in August, 1934. We deeply regret to report the death, which occurred on the night of March 21st, of Davang Haji Sadiah. the widow of the late Datu Temonggong. Dayang Sadiah, who was in her ninetieth year, was a close friend of Her Highness the Ranee Margaret, and also of His Highness the Rajah. An obituary notice appears elsewhere in this issue. The European population of Sibu has recently been suffering from a form of dysentery which is believed to have been caused by contamination of the water supply. Investigations are proceeding. The March number of Mirage maintains the high standard that we long ago came to expect from what the Editor (or should it he �Editress�?) rightly describes as our re nowned Quarterly.� The articles are as varied and interesting as ever, and make us more than a little envious : how does Mirage secure such excellent contributions? By bribery, flattery, or intimidation? For it is our bitter experience that no other means will induce the average European in Sarawak to take up his (or her) pen and write a column or two for the Gazette, and presumably what is true of Kuching and Sibu is true of Miri. At any rate, those responsible deserve a hearty pat on the back for bringing out a magazine that is a long wav ahead of the usual amateur production. We have only one very minor criticism to oiler, and that is to register a mild protest at Mirage�s persis tent mis-spelling of the word �Dayak�. Nobody writes �Kyan� or �Hari Rya� : why. then, �Dyak�? Mr. and Mrs. C. D. Le Gros Clark left Kuching on March 21st. Mr Le Gros Clark, who visited Malaya on duty in connection with rubier restriction, returned on March 30th; Mrs. Le Gros Clark is touring Java, and will he away for about a month. The discoveny that Sarawak Certificates of Identity were being extensively forged necessitated a visit to Singapore on the part of Mr. E. M. Selous, Acting Secretary for Chinese Affairs and Officer-in-Charge of Immigration. Mr. Selous left Kuching on March 25th and returned on the 30th. We welcome back to Sarawak Mr. and Mrs. W. F. Dick. Mr. W. Crocker, Mrs. C. E. Pascoe and Miss Patricia Pascoe, who arrived in Kuching by the Vyner Brooke un March 30th. Mr. Dick is to act as Government Secretary during the absence of Mr. Crocker, who is shortly proceeding to Europe on sick leave; he has also been appointed Chairman of the Commission that is to consider the Blue Report. The other members of this Com mission are Messrs. C. D. Le Gros Clark, F. H. Pollard, R. G. Aikman, with Messrs. J. B. Archer and A. Macpherson outstation members. We understand that Mr. Lowry will relieve Mr. R. F. Sinclair as Superintendent of Customs and Shipping, Fourth Division. Mr. Sinclair will return to Kuching. The final of the Billiards Tournament for European members of St. Michael's Catholic Club was played off at the Club on March 20th, the winner being Mr. W. J. Chater, who beat Mr. K. Cargill by 13 in a match of 100 up. Mr. Chater faithfully observed the old custom of filling the cup he had won with champagne and handing it round the spectators. An Appreciation of the Late Mr. D. James. The death of the late Mr. D. James took place, after a short illness, at the General Hospital, Kuching, on 21st March, 1936, at the age of 59. He was an old resident of Sarawak, having made this country his home lor the last twenty-three years. He was a very clever research chemist, and was readily accessible to anyone seeking his advice. All those who ever came into contact with him can testify to his many acts of kindness, and his unfail ing willingness to assist them on whatever technical points they desired information. To him money was a thing of no importance, since the mere pleasure in being able to render assistance of any kind to anybody was sufficient recompense to him. He was held in high esteem by all his friends for his sincerity and integrity in all his dealings with them; he was a man of the most retiring character, since whatever he did, he never wished it to come into publicity. By his death Sarawak has lost a very good citizen, for undoubtedly he did a lot of good work for the country.�Contributed. Obituary RUBBER REGULATION. New Development in the Constabulary. FORMATION OF "SECTION B." On January 1st, 1932, the Sarawak Rangers and the Sarawak Police were amalgamated to form tlie force now known as the Sarawak Constabulary. This measure was carried out primarily in the interests of economy, but other factors were also taken into consideration when the re-organisation of the two forces was first proposed. During the years immediately preceding the amalgamation it had become increasingly evident that the Sarawak Rangers had outlived their usefulness as a purely military force; and by 1931 it was also obvious that reform was needed in the Police. The decade that ended in 1931 was on the whole a period of marked prosperity for the State, and in consequence development in all branches nf the Administration was rapid,�a little too rapid, indeed, according to some observers, for nowhere does the motto "Festina lente" apply more aptly than in the East. At any rate, the old rough-and-ready-outstation Police got left behind in the nice, and it was realized that unless something was done to raise the standard of the force it would be unable to cope with modern conditions. It was therefore decided to amalgamate the Rangers and the Police into a single force which would combine military efficiency with a high standard of competence in Police work. The object was successfully achieved with the help of an Adviser who brought to his task the fruits of many years� experience in the Malayan Police. The Sarawak Constabulary owes a very great debt to Mr. C. Hannigan who. with the assistance of local Police officers, completely re-organised the force and laid the foundations nf the Constabulary as we know it to-day. He instituted a new system of recruitment and training which has produced remarkable results in the comparatively short time that it has been in operation. A now type nf unstable has been produced who is noticeably superior in intelligence and education to the old outstation policeman, and as a result a great improvement can be noted in the smartness and efficiency of the force as a whole. At the same time, the Dayak troubles of the past few years have shown that there is still a lot to he said for the old style �roughneck� policeman, who. although he had never heard of the Criminal Pro cedure Code, could usually be depended upon to vanish into the blue and return with a wanted man three weeks (or three months) later. Sometimes, admittedly, he used rather questionable methods in effecting an arrest, but the fact remains that more often than not he got his man,�in the ulu, at any rate. His rough-and-ready methods were well enough suited to the jungle, and although in most cases his only qualifications for his job were physical fitness, a certain native shrewdness, and�most important of all �a thorough knowledge of the people with whom he had to deal, they were sufficient for what was required of him. and enabled him to carry out his duties satisfactorily. Though quite useless at controlling traffic or investigating a difficult case in the bazaar, he could pole and paddle a boat, and was prepared to scramble over high hills for days on end, if necessary. and live on the shortest of commons. A review of the conditions that prevailed touring the prolonged operations against Dayak outlaws in the Second and Third Divisions led Government to decide on the inclusion of a special military force within the Constabulary. This has been done, and the result is the force known as .�Section B�, which is at present in the process of formation. �Section B� is essentially a jungle force. It is destined for duty in the Ulu, and recruits are chosen with this end in view; literacy is not insisted upon, but recruits must be of first-class physique and reasonable intelligence. Their equipment is simple and eminently practi cal; it consists of a standard terendak�, an open necked shirt and shorts of dark green material, a leather belt and ammunition pouch, and a zinc basong�, in which are carried spare clothes and provisions. The men wear no boots or puttees, but a pair of light rubber-soled shoes are provided which can be put on when walking up a rocky stream-bed, or on any other occasion where some protection for the feet is necessary. When not in use, these shoes are carried in the basong. The men are armed with a .303 carbine and a standard parang. The advantage of a light carbine over the ordinary service rifle for patrol work is obvious. The bayonet, of course, is merely a nui sance and an encumbrance in the jungle, whereas a parang. in addition to being the natural weapon of the natives, can be used in a hundred and one different ways when on patrol. It comes in handy for clearing pathways, for instance, for cutting down trees and undergrowth, building shelters, chopping fire-wood, and so on. and it is also useful in a hand-to-hand encounter. The parang is to the natives of Sarawak what the kukri is to the Ghurka; with a parang in his hand he can face an enemy with confidence, but he is clumsy with a bayonet , which in any rase is not a suitable weapon for jungle warfare. "Section B" will eventually be split up into three platoons A, B and C, each composed of 34 non commissioned officers and men. Platoon A will garrison the new station at Nunga Meluan in the heart of the Third Division Dayak country; platoon B will be stationed at Lubok Antu in the Second Division; and platoon C will remain in reserve at the depot, and will supply relief N.C.O.�s and men for platoons A and B. There is no doubt that "Section B" will prove of great value in maintaining law and order in the interior. This small military force, will form a valuable complement to the main body of regular Constabulary. and will undoubtedly lie well fitted for the duties it will be called upon to perform 1 Conical sun-hat made of woven rattan. 2 Container made on the lines of a Dayak basket and carried on the back by means of shoulder-straps. Antimony in Sarawak. By L. SAMERESINGHE. Let us then be up and doing, To improve our country� s Fate; Still achieving, still pursuing, Learn to labour and to wait.-Longfellow. Antimony is a brittle metal identical in colour with tin, and crystalline in structure. It is rarely found in nature in a free state, and not in many countries. The chief source of the metal is stibnite, a mineral composed of two atoms of antimony held in chemical combination with three atoms of sulphur. On exposure to the natural weathering influence of air or water, the superior affinity fur antimony in stibnite of oxygen in the air or water brings about the displacement of the sulphur atoms, and antimony oxide is formed; but this chemical re-action, unlike laboratory re-actions, requires a prolonged period of time. The sequence of this change is naturally in keeping with observed facts in all antimony-producing countries, that the occur rence of antimony oxide as an outcrop is a never failing indication of a vein or lode of antimony sulphide or stibnite deeper down. The uses of antimony are numerous, viz., to harden alloys for anti-friction metals, for printer's metal, drugs, pigments, and last but. not least, for shrapnel. This last use sends up its price to sudden and absurd heights during times of war, and should the Abyssinian affray unfortunately develop into a world war on a big scale, an abnormal rise in price must inevitably- ensue. During the last Great European war the price of antimony soared up to ?130 a ton, and even at that exorbitant price its scarcity compelled the use of poor substitutes. Antimony ore almost always contains, more or less gold and silver, with traces of the rarer metals, and especially in Sarawak this is more the rule than the exception The process employed for the separa tion of these two precious metals is the condensation of the fumes resulting from the volatilization of the metal by furnace hear. The world�s production of antimony in the year 1926 was over 30,000 tons, and Bolivia, Mexico, France, Italy, Jugo-Slavia and China were the principal producing countries. The province of Hunan, China, produced more than half the world�s requirements, and the Hunan Antimony Syndicate, composed of the Hunan Government, the miners and smelters, was incorporated within recent years with the sole right of export, and to control pro duction with a view to securing better prices. In 1926 this Syndicate contrived to raise the price in the world's markets to �100 c.i.f. London. Mexico then ventured to compete with China, and, favoured by reason of her proximity, ousted China in the American markets, but China still retains a predominant position in European capitals. Japan is the biggest buyer, and in view of her nearness to Sarawak, it would be very interesting to investigate the possibilities of increasing production in the State of Sarawak, where nature seems to have stored up antimony in lavish abundance. It is not outside the realms of possibility, and, in the opinion of the writer, is even within regions of probability, that Sarawak will rival China some day in the not too distant future, should some scheme on the lines of the Hunan Syndicate be framed, embodying such modifications and additions as would be consistent with local requirements. To those uninitiated in matters of this nature, and to others interested in the export trade in minerals, the cogent reasons for advocating the introduction of such a scheme may remain obscure. The outstanding broad disparity between the local price, in the neighbourhood of $3 per picul, a sum sadly inadequate to cover even cooly labour and transport expenses, and the pro fitable quotations at. which exporters sell to metal merchants in Europe and Japan, disclose a situation of discord that is pregnant with cause for complaint and valid grounds for demanding a satisfactory explanation. There is genuine justification for maintaining that if earnest endeavours to induce vigorous search for the mineral be fostered and encouraged by the accompaniment of a correspond ing appropriate reward, more deposits will be discovered and worked; but the fact must not be forgotten that in the absence of a fair profit to the miner commensurate with the London or Osaka market. and framed to defeat the trade tricks of exporters, a tendency to militate against the funda mental features of the scheme would arise. The accumulated results of painstaking scientific research and steady progress in the manufacture of alloys made since the advent of the electric furnace, which largely does away with the deficiencies of the human factor, and requires most delicate and laborious experiments, secretly pursued in the State aided laboratories of the Great Powers both for destructive and constructive purposes, have com bined to push on antimony to a prominent position amongst the minor metals; such minor metals, that is to say. that were left to idle away from the dawn of the chemical age without uses being found for them through ignorance of their valuable attributes. They are now finding new "billets" and displacing those hitherto used and considered as being obsolete or not "up to the mark" to-day. The metallurgical chemist is ever trying to bring into being a better and better alloy, cheaper in price, of enhanced ability to withstand variations and temperature, increased resistance of oxidation, and wear and tear. greater lightness, and greater durability than the one now in use, or an entirely fresh alloy suited to the requirements of some special constructional part of machinery of recent invention. In this inventive age. antimony may be counted upon as one of the minor metals, indispensable in industry, and in view of the inquiries from Japan, it is not unreasonable to draw the inference that a use has been found for the metal which will most assuredly be kept as a well-guarded secret. Economy and efficiency are the two leading and vital factors, on which metallurgists are basing their experimental studies amongst the minor metals. In this short and inadequate account of antimony it is decidedly filling to make a. reference to the fact that the first Rajah of Sarawak was aware of antimony becoming a valuable asset of the State, and the remembrance of this fact ought to engender a grateful sense of appreciation, which would con vey considerable support for any scheme designed to increase production and confer on the small miner the benefits of a moderate margin of profit. Rotary Doctrines Preached in Kuching. Mr. Khan Ah Chong, a Past Vice-President of the Kuala Lumpur Rotary Club, has been appointed a Special Representative of the Governor of the 80th District R.I. with a view to the forma tion of a new Club at Kuching, Sarawak. A dinner was given by him at the Government Rest House on the '29th February in order that some of the Rotary doctrines might be preached to those Who might take interest in the Rotary movement. There were present about 30 guests comprising some of the Government officials and the leading Asiatic merchants, etc. After the usual pre liminaries of thanking those concerned in the loan of the Rest House and in the arrangements of the dinner and the guests for having so kindly accepted his invitation Mr. Khan Ah Cong said :� "There is one thing about which I am sorry and that is I did not invite the ladies, because there is a very unfortunate ruling in Rotary that at business meetings no ladies arc permitted. Whether this ruling is fortunate or unfortunate I will not argue that point here but personally I think, dinners once in a way, without lalies are very welcome. They certainly breathe an air of freedom, you don't have to observe any conventions or etiquette. You can discuss and talk about things freely and I hope you thus enjoy yourselves to-night." He went on to say that he first came over here in May last year and the first thing that struck him after a few days stay was that the people were living very peacefully. "As I stayed longer" he continued "I studied the economic life of the community as a whole and there appears to me that there is not much unity and co-operation existing among the cosmopolitan crowd that forms the popula tion of the place, as each creed is carrying on its profession or trade quite separately and independently. I may be wrong but that has been my observation. I pondered over this condition of life and came to the conclusion that to bring about unity and co-operation it is only Rotary that can do it and if the lack of unity is any evil at all, it is only Rotary that can remedy it. Therefore I considered that a Rotary Club is very desirable here. I communicated with the District Governor, H. R. H. Prince Purachatra, at Singapore. He was satisfied with my report and also with the knowledge of Rotary that I possess through having been connected with it for number of years and having held a number of posts of responsibility. I was then appointed a Special Representative and therefore I am hern to convert some of you to be Rotarians. Some of you maybe wonder ing and asking why do I want to form such a Club here and what benefit do I get from it. Lot me tell you that 1 do it purely out of my Rotary spirit because it is the duty of every Rotarian to promote the formation of new Clubs wherever and whenever they arc desirable. The theory of waiting for a community to want Rotary is fallacious, it is the duty of every Rotarian to create in a community a desire for Rotary. Another reason is that I have every confidence that Rotary in time will prove beneficial to the Members themselves, to the Government, and to the public. As to the point of what benefit I expect, I can assure you that I do not expect any. I am not paid for the job and whatever benefits I get, will be those as other Rotarians enjoy. I will now try and give you some of the fine qualities of Rotary. Rotary was founded in Chicago, U.S.A., in the year 1905 by an American lawyer named Paul P. Harris. When he opened his law office there, he had much time for reflection and pondered much on conditions of life and business in a large city, where to outward appearances the chief stimulus to human activity was not the Golden Rulo but the desire for gold and silver. As a result of his studies and reflections Mr. Harris had formulated a definite philosophy of business relations. He had by this time made some friends and called together three of them each of whom was engaged in a different line of business He expounded his theory of them, that was to draw one man from each recognized business or professional or institutional activity in the community to form a Club, to meet to gether wherein the members might not only become acquainted with one another, not also device means of making themselves proficient in thoughtfulness of, and helpfulness to, each other. A club was then formed but at first the members did not inert at luncheon but met in rotation at the offices or places of business of the various members, and from this rotation the word Rotary had sprung up. At first it took a long time for Rotary to take root, because it was not until 1910 before a second Rotary Club waa formed and I hat was in Canada. After that Rotary spread like wild-fire, and the latest statistics available up to 20th December last year give the total number of Chibs all over the world at 3,899 with the addition of Iceland aa the latest recruit. The total membership on 20th December, 1935, was 164,773. From 1910 to last year, that is a lapse of 25 years, new Rotary Clubs had been chartered on an average of one every two and one-third days. There are something like 340 Rotary Clubs in the British Isles and about 45 in the London area alone. It is in London, therefore, that you find probably the most intensified group of Rotarians in the world. What then is the secret of Rotary�s strength and universal popularity equally in all nations and with all people? There are so many answers tn it, and the following arc a few of them. If Rotary is not worth while the 164,000 odd of the leading men in the various countries won Id certainly not become part of it. Its motives are good, because it places its methods, its aims and objects, frankly before the world, and is open qually to the member and non-member; its efforts are sincere because it tries to bring people into close friendly contact; it has no secret? because it appeals to all creeds and ignores all national boundaries; its is non-political therefore it can never he wrecked on the rocks of political arguments, since it demands of its members first of all good citizenship; it is non-sectarian because it has shocked no faith and offended no custom: it has no mystic rites; it arouses no greed, because Rotary can never be accused of selfishness or profiteering or the acceptance of membership to benefit financially one�s business or profession; it can never be accused of disloyality since it stands for the rights of nations and believes in patriotism; it is not even a pacificist organiza-tion; it believes that participation in certain wars has been necessary in the past, it can foresee conditions by which participation may be necessary in the future. It does desire, however, to do what it can to increase tolerance, and lessen misunderstandings and hatreds between nations that there may be avoided the atmosphere in which wars flourish. Rotary does not feel that there is anything in loyalty to one's country that is incompatible with deve loping friendship with men of other lands. In fact Rotary believes that the citizen who bcst serves his country is the one who wishes to know the truth about his neighbours and who desires to replace hatreds between nations and people with friendship. International friendship, how ever, is not by any means Rotary's only objective. There arc also the community and vocational services along which Rotary can achieve quite a lot. A Club in a community will, after careful study, help with the thing that in the light of local conditions seems the most important for it to turn its hands to. One cannot expect to do much in the development of a world friendship without friendliness at home. We have here men of several racial groups. They are representative and influential men in the community. Do what you can then to develop and maintain tolerance, good-will and co-operation and even if there is no other objective the formation of a Rotary Club here is well and fully justified. There is no other explanation for the great and rapid spread of Rotary all over the world than that the Rotary idea works and that Rotary is well worth one's attention. One of America�s famous cynics. Sinclair Lewis, stated quite a number of years ago while he was in England 'I assert that the growth of Rotary in Great Britain where it already has hundreds of chapters is more im portant for world tranquillity than all the campaigns of the reformers put together. Rotary appeals strongly to me because of the work that it is doing in building up the world fellowship. I assure you, gentlemen, that friendship between countries can never be ? brought about by treaties or by the kind won! of diplomats regardless of the desire of official dom for it. International amity can only come about through the world desiring friendship. And friendship is not brought about by merely the acceptance of it as an ideal. It must be brought about by contact. Now Rotary brings about this conflict by making it one of the obligations of a Rotarian that he attends Rotary meetings wherever he may be. While your membership is in one Club your attendance need not be there only. You may attend any where in the world and the Rotarians of other countries have equally the privilege to attend your meetings. Thus we have 164,000 odd Rotarians in about 65 different countries fra ternising together in a close and splendid fellowship at every possible opportunity. We believe that if we meet a man and like him we will like Ins country just a little bit letter through liking him. Rotarians are of a class who travel much. They attend Rotary Clubs wherever they may he. That is their duty. We know they go home with a friendly feeling for the countries which they have visited trough their contact with Rotarians. They express their opinions in their Clubs, in their craft associations, to their friends outside and then, like a wave, their friendliness for their neigh bours passes out further and further and we know not where it will end. Most of the dislikes, most of their hatreds that exist between countries and nations are due merely to lack of contact. We do not speak badly of our friends and we do not wish to quarrel with them. Our friendships must not be limited to the boundaries of our own nations. Just so long as we permit ourselves to live in exclusive groups, to ignore the other fellow, to allow our nationalism to make us quite content to associate solely with those of our own nationality and to believe in them alone, then just so long do we encourage intolerance and even bitterness that can easily have serious results. At present there are over 1,000 club bulletins issued by Rotary Clubs throughout the world and Clubs of different countries combine in getting out some really first-class magazines. In all the publications you cannot read a word of abuse of other countries or of other people. Rotary, I am happy to say, is the cult of those who wish to think well of their neighbours and who desire to dwell on their virtues rather than on their defects. No speaker at a Rotary Club meeting is expected to speak in criticism of countries with whom we are at peace. It is not that criticism is not sometimes desirable, it is not that criticism is not sometimes necessary. There are, however, so many people going about the world, so many agencies, so many news papers. so many books, and I fear I must say, so many religions, that are dealing with other people's defects that Rotary believes there should be just a little room somewhere for an organiza tion that desires to specialise on friendship. Each of us has our own defects and in over looking our neighbours imperfections we trust he will be equally desirous of overlooking ours. In fact is it not almost necessary, if we are going to avoid great wars in the future, that tolerance and appreciation and co-operation be taught somewhere? Rotary is often spoken of as a bridge builder became it can construct bridges wherever there are gaps occurring so that one section of the community can cross over to the other and vice versa whereby one section may be in a better position to understand the other's views, their happiness, their joys and their pro blems. Rotary has six objects as follows :- To encourage and footer 1. The ideal of SERVICE as the basis of all worthy enterprise. 2. High ethical standards in business and professions. 3. The application of the ideal of service by every Rotarian to his personal, business and community life. 4. The development of acquaintance as an opportunity for service. 5. The. recognition of the worthiness of all useful occupations and the dignifying by each Rotarian of his occupation as an oppor tunity to serve society. 6. The advancement of understanding, good-will and international peace through a world fellowship of business and professional men united in the ideal of service. and its motto is :� "Service above self." "He profits most who serves best." Rotary is a far-reaching movement and for such a movement to be a real force in society it must have a defined programme which a Rotarian can carry out in four avenues or directions, namely :� First.�In Club service which means a Rotarian�s contributions in attendance, fellow- ship, programme participation, etc., in his Rotary Club. Second.�In vocational service which means his service in his business and in the general trade of which his particular busincss is a part. Third.�In community service which means doing his good-sized bit as a neighbour and a citizen. Fourth.�In international service which means widening his horizon and extending his view beyond international boundaries, the doing of things for men in other countries that will help and make secure the good relations now existing between his country and other countries and prevent the development of strained relation and wars. These four channels can be very much more amplified, but I have no time for it. Rotary is administered by an international Board the members of which change each year and are elected at an International Convention hold yearly. As evidence of the international nature of the organization I will give you the 1935-1936 constitution. The President is a man clawed under (railroad commissary contracting) from Virginia, named Mr. Ed. R. Johnson.

Air-Commodore Smith's Story of R.A.F. Flight. ADVENTURES IN STORM AND FOG. HOW THEY HEARD OF TOKIO REVOLT. Air Commodore Sydney Smith, Air Officer Commanding the R.A.F., Far East, who has just returned to Singapore after having led the greatest flight that has been carried out so far by the R.A.F. in East, told his story to the Straits Times of the goodwill journey of the three Singapore III's from Seletar to Sarawak, British North Borneo, the Philip pines, and China. Air-Commodore Smith was informed of the Tokio disturbance, which caused the can cellation of the flight to Japan, by Admiral K. Oikawa, Senior Japanese Naval Officer at Shanghai. Through the British Air Attache at Shanghai, Group-Captain R. P. Willcock, Admiral Oikawa expressed his deep regret to Air Commodore Smith that the trouble in Tokio had made it impracticable for him to continue his flight to Japan in the Singapore Ill�s. The R.A.F. fliers were given a great reception at all the places they visited. Their reception in Shanghai and Nanking was particularly cordial, said Air-Commodore Smith. The flying boats had many adventures of storm and fog, engine trouble and landings on choppy seas. Air-Commodore Smith said that the first delay was at their first stopping place�Kuching. There was an incessant storm from 4 a.m. to 11 a.m. with no visibility. The Kuching authorities said it was the most violent storm in history. There were trees and debris on the river, and it would have been madness to take off with a heavy load. They left next morning for Kudat, British North Borneo, where they stayed the night. Early next day they left for Manila. About 100 miles from Kudat one engine failed in the Singapore III which was carrying his flag. Wing-Commander Scott, who was in charge of this flying boat, kept it cruising comfortably on three engines. The aircraft only lost five knots in speed, and formation was maintained. At Manila examination proved that the engine that had failed would have to come out. They signalled Hong Kong to Bend a Rolls �Kestrel� engine. The other two flying beats then left for Hong Kong. He had transferred his flag from Wing Commander Scott's aircraft to one under Squadron Leader Lloyd's command. Leaving Manila at 6.15 a.m., the flying boats passed over the Pratas Reef, where the City of Cambridge could he seen stranded. Al Hong Kong a guard of honour was provided by the Royal Welsh Fusiliers, and a salute was fired. The next stage of the flight was eventful. Air-Commodore �Smith said that the flying boats waited at Hong Kong until 11.30, hoping that the fog would clear away. About 100 miles out on their way to Amoy the fog closed down. I have never seen thick fog form so quickly,� said the Air-Commodore. "We also had informa tion that the. fog was thickening near Amoy, and we had no alternative but tn return to Hong Kong. �Next day was still bad, with fog and drizzle. On that day Wing-Commander Scott flew his engine direct from Manila to Amoy. He was north of the worst weather, but he struck a storm south of Formosa. "We decided also to fly direct to Shanghai, but the weather was unfavourable, and we had to come down at Amoy. "At Amoy one of the engines in Squadron-Leader Lloyd's boat showed a defect, and it hud to be replaced from Hong Kong. Wing-Commdr. Scott's and Flt.-Lieut. Riccard's boats flew on. "After passing Foochow the weather became worse. The fog closed round us, and we decided it was inadvisable to go on. We landed on Nam Quam Bay. and dropped anchor in choppy water. �Immediately we were surrounded by sampans. The Chinese in this region had never seen anything like this before. �On the hills thousands of black-clad Chinese swarmed in a few moments, and more junks and sampans arrived. "When the tide went out, we lay high and dry on the mud, and then we saw an amazing spectacle. Chinese began to swarm round the flying boats on peculiar wooden scooters, which they pushed across two feet of soft mud. They tapped the hull and wings, and were very curious, but none of them could speak English. "We slept in the flying boats all night, and the sloop H.M.S. Sandwich arrived from Hong Kong. It was impossible to take off for some time, but eventually we got away to Shanghai."�Straits Times. Bridge Hints From �The Butler.� CONTRACT FOR CLUBMEN. Valuing the Hand. It is vital that an accurate valuation of the hand should be made. Disastrous aud unpleasant con sequences follow inability to settle the score occasioned by too many bids. Always remember that the more quick tricks you have, the better; they will get you out of many tight corners, and if you play these tricks properly you are certain to put many of your opponents� bids down (but see �Rule of Eight" infra). The Rule of Eight. Under normal conditions, eight is considered to be a maximum (for abnormal conditions "One over the eight"). This latter case is usually the result of having under-valued one's hand and over-valued one�s capacity. Bidding and Responses. Before you bid, always look at the score�for example, if you stand three, make sure that, the other players also stand three before you raise to four. If, however, you have learned bidding on either the Hounsditch or Aberdeen system�always let the others open the bidding, and if possible make no bids yourself. While one may save money by the use of these systems, one is apt to lose caste, and they are not recoin mended. Keep your eye on the score,�this is most important, as inability to meet the demand bids are apt to lead one into deep water (always to be avoided), and finesse will he necessary to avoid the grand slam. Responses can either be negative or positive� the greater number of quick tricks you hold the more positive should your responses be, more especially when anyone has interposed with a bid. Doubling. If your partner has not bid, and your score sheet is empty�you may double any original bid by the others. This shows great strength, and partner should reply by showing his preference either by calling a major (or double), or a minor (single), or a no trump (stengah). "Flag Flying." This is deliberate overcalling in order to save one's face�The method is this�If in danger of too much going down, so that it may possibly come up, immediately either double any call or call three or four. This will unsettle the others, and you will pro bably get a negative response. Only in cases of extreme weakness should this be resorted to. and here is a table showing the risks it is worth while taking. After 1st Round�up to 8 2nd ,, 7 3rd ,, 6 4th ,, 5 and so on down to the 7th Round, after which as an exception 3 should be called�at this stage such a call has a most demoralising effect. Note.�It is essential that any bids of this des cription should always total to at least �one over the eight.� Systems. The �One over one"�is the oldest, safest and most popular, and as it implied, means that each player calls in relation, no doubles or re-doubles being permitted until "one over the eight� has been reached. The Natural Bid. When using this system, a bid means exactly what it says. Vulnerability. This implies entering a game after one has made several bids by oneself, and the others have just started a round. The newcomers are non-vulncr able until each has either made or accepted a bid. Once a person has become vulnerable by accep tance of a bid, he is in honour bound to make a bid himself. (But see notes on bidding on Houns ditch and Aberdeen systems supra). The One Club Convention. The two most famous examples of this convention are the Barton Club (not very satisfactory), and the Canadian Club (eminently satisfying). The latter is a very potent convention, and should be sparingly bid for. Forcing Calls. Be chary of using these forcing calls-the golden rule is "Let your partner speak : don't make him.� If your partner cannot support you it is useless to force a bid from him, as in that case you may have to meet the score when the bid has gone down. You must always have great strength and a good many quick tricks to force partner to bid. Imperial Airways Ltd. 14th March, 1936.

Japanese Fishing Industry. �BIGGEST IN WORLD.� Singapore is being made the chief transhipment centre for the catches of Japanese trawlers which sail in the South China seas, the Indian Ocean, and as far south as Australia. Recently two trawlers transhipped 200 tons of frozen fish caught in the Indian Ocean and Aus tralian waters. One of the vessels had 2,000 pack ages of frozen bream and red porgy, caught off Western Australia. Frozen fish are transhipped at Singapore to vessels which take it direct to Japan. Most of it is for domestic consumption, as the Japanese are big fish-eaters, but some is made into fish meal and exported to all parts of the world. Japan boasts, according to the British United Press, that her fishing industry is the biggest in the world. With a view to further expansion scientists are travelling on the trawlers operating from Singapore to investigate ocean fishing conditions. Their re ports are forwarded to a new research institute ou ocean fisheries.�Sunday Times. Films of the Month When Charles Laughton's name appears on a programme, no one bothers very much about the film. For one thing, it is taken for granted that no directors in their senses would dare to feature him in a second rate picture: for another, his reputation is now such that it would not make very much difference if they did. It is Laughton who matters, and not the story. When he is on the screen, deficiencies of plot and production arc forgotten in the thrill of watching the finest of contemporary character actors. Laughton by him is sufficient entertainment for most of us. This altitude, which at first sight appears mere hero-worship (crooners and matinee idols ran com mand much the same kind of blind adoration from thoir fans), is justified by events. Each time Laughton appears in a new picture we wonder whether he will maintain the high standard he has set for himself; and each time he not only main tains it, but surpasses it. Laughton, as an actor, is in a class by himself. He is a phenomenon, a prodigy, arid we can only wait in breathless amaze ment for each fresh triumph, knowing with utter certainty that it will come. During March, we were ablc to see this remark able actor in two widely different roles, and in each of them he was perfect; there is no other word for it. As Javert in Les Miserables he brought to life a character so psychologically absurd that in the book it never really begins to live. This is no mean feat. The average talkie audience is more critical in this respect than were most of Victor Hugo�s contemporary readers, brought up, as they were, in the tradition of early Victorian melodrama. In the book, Javert was never quite credible, yet in the film he lived. Laughton's subtle alchemy turned the stony-hearted warder, the relentless and inhuman police officer, into a living being in whom we could believe. Moreover, much as we might hate him and all that, he stood for, we could not but respect him, for Laughton invested this most unlovable figure with a strange dignity. Javert's magnificent outburst when Valjean pardoned him after he had denounced himself for an error of judgment that had put him, the fanatical guardian of the law, within reach of the law, was extra ordinarily impressive. So, too, was the scene in the Paris sewers, when Javert, at the mercy of his victim, he refused to deviate one inch from his duty, knowing that this refusal would almost certainly cost him his life. And if his final suicide was unconvincing, that was not the fault of Laughton, but of the directors, who, incidentally, were for once justified in �cooking� a story to provide a happy ending. All hough artistically a mistake, Javert�s suicide was emotionally necessary; Victor Hugo's sombre masterpiece would otherwise have been altogether too harrowing. Fredric March gave the performance of his life as Jean Valjean, the hero. As the embittered galley-slave sent sentenced to ten years' of hell for the theft of a loaf of bread; as the successful business man and magistrate, who had built up a new life out of the ruins of his past as the hunted fugitive fleeing always from the wrath to come in the person of Javert, he was superb. Each phase of Vaijean�s eventful life was portrayed with understanding and a real sense of dramatic values. Fredric March has achieved a high level of technique, and is an actor gifted both with talent, and imagination. Sir Cedric Hardwicke was excellent as Bishop Bienvenu, a sympathetic but difficult part in which the slightest lapse into sentimentality would have spelt disaster, and the remainder of a strung sup porting cast all contributed to the success of an exceptionally good film, and one, moreover, which has a moral which should not be lost on us to-day. Victor Hugo's story is melodramatic, certainly, but it is also impressive, chiefly becanse it is the impassioned protest of a great thinker against man's appalling cruelty to man,� or rather, against the unthinking cruelty of the ''haves" to the �have nots.'' And incidentally, if we consider ten years in the galleys rather a stiff sentence for stealing a loaf of bread, do not let us forget that less than a century ago farm labourers in England were transported for poaching a pheasant or a hare. Contrary to most indications, it does really seem that we have made a little progress in the last hundred years,�in some directions, at any rate. Les Miserahles was a first-rate film, and if we have taken up an undue amount of space in reviewing it, it is because it just cannot he dis missed in a couple of paragraphs. The same can be said of Ruggles of Red Gap the other Laughton film, which is certainly one of the two or three best pictures that have yet come to the Sylvia Cinema. In this Laughton stars as a comedian, an unusual role far an actor who is ordinarily cast in peculiarly villainous or unpleasant parts (Laughton is rapidly establishing for himself a niche in the cinema industry as the Screen's Swellest Sadist), but one in which his genius is more than ever apparent. He takes the part of Ruggles, the prim English valet, who, while in Paris, is lost at poker by Lord Burnstead, his master, to Egbert Floud (Charles Ruggles), a middle-aged American nouveau riche, and who consequently accompanies Flood and bis socially ambitious wife (Mary Roland) to Red Gap, a primitive settlement somewhere in the State of Washington. There is material in plenty for comedy in this idea, and Laughton and the pro ducers take full advantage of it. The reactions of Laughton, in whom the tradition of service is so deeply ingrained that it has become second nature, to his new and strange environment are both unexpected and diverting. Once again Laughton lived the part. He was the soul and spirit of valetry. the embodiment of suave efficiency and faithful and self-effacing service. He was Jeeves in the flesh; and the scene in which he and Lord Burnstead (Roland Young) bid each other farewell prior to Ruggles� departure for America was per fectly done-a little masterpiece of characteri sation all the more effective for its restraint. Roland Young (Uriah Heap in David Copperfield) is a fine actor, and one to watch. His performance as the charming but eccentric Earl was flawless. Charles Ruggles, who, when well directed, is an asset to any picture, was delightful as the warm hearted parvenu, and Mary Boland, who partners him so successfully, did ample justice, to a parti cularly �fat" part. Maude Eburne was splendidly earthy as the hard-bailed American woman more at home in a bar than in a drawing-room. Zazu Pitts contrived to make Mrs. Judson, Ruggles' faded lady love, completely colourless, but no doubt this was intended. Of the remaining films, Death on the Diamond was a first rate American thriller packed with crooks, racketeers and gamblers, and scintillating with wise-cracks. As the title implies, the story deals with professional baseball, and is concerned with the desperate attempts of an unknown enemy to ruin the star team. We were treated to no less than three murders, and so well were they done that they did not appear excessive or improbable. Paul Kelly was splendid as a hard-boiled newspaper reporter, and stood out. prominently in an excel lent ill-round cast. There is a distinct attraction about these quick-fire American crook play a with their rapid action and their crew of thugs, cops, and sweet young ladies, and this film nearly reached the level of The Thin Man. Good wise-crack : �Say, you�re pretty smart, ain�t ya?� �Oh, no, it ain�t that; it's just that it seems so to people that ain�t as smart as I am." George White's 1935 Scandals was a mediocre musical show which yet succeeded in being rea sonably good entertainment. To a great extent this was due to Ned Sparks, the Man With The Iron Face, whose performance as a Southern barn stormer and small-town mayor was a joy- Eleanor Powell's tap-dancing was little short of miraculous, �oh boy, oh boy, what a figure! What speed! What technique!�And George White as Himself was adequate. He could not go far wrong in this part, at any rate. Sylvia Cinema. PROVISIONAL SCHEDULE OF PROGRAMME Sarawak Library. March, I936. The following books have been added to the Library:� First Division News. FEBRUARY . Sixty-three civil and fifty-eight criminal cases came before the Kuching Courts during February. At an inquest into the death of a Chinese named Chang Niang Choong, who was drowned at Batu Kawa on the 15th February, a verdict of accidental death by drowning was returned. The Assistant District Officer, Mr. G. F. J. Pegler, proceeded to Lundu by m.l. Betty on January 28th and returned to Kuching on February 15th. While in Lundu. he visited villages at Serayan, Sebiris, Sedamak, Sebuku, Paun and Simatan. No matters of any particular importance were brought up for discussion. During the second week of February very heavy seas were running off the coast of Lundu, and m.l. Betty was held up at Kuala Lundu on the return journey to Kuching for four days. 368 persons were treated at Bau Government Dispensary during February, and 118 N.A.B. in jections were given. The Principal Medical Officer visited the station once during the month. The District Officer, Bau, states that the kam pongs round Gunong Serembu were visited according to programme, but there is little of importance to report. It is interesting to note, incidentally, that the Segobang Dayaks set their clocks by the 5 o'clock gun in Kuching, which is some sixteen miles away. The number of applications for gun permits by Land Dayaks is amazing. It shows, however, that there is plenty of money circulating amongst these people. Dahan Rubber Estates harvested 5,000 lbs. of dry rubber during February. There is little doubt that a considerable amount of rubber smuggling is going on in Upper Sarawak, Chinese and Land Dayaks being concerned. While on a border patrol Corporal Ali succeeded in arresting two Chinese and sixteen Dutch Dayaks, who had some seven pikuls of rubber bearing Sarawak stencil numbers which clearly could not have been produced by the stencil holders. One of the Chinese had a letter in his possession signed by the Kapitan China. Png. Tebang, warn ing him to be careful, as the police were rather inquisitive! The case has not yet come up for hearing. Corporal Ali is to be congratulated on an excellent piece of work. The Batu Kitang Road is improving, in spite of the exceptionally bad weather. Kerangan was laid down where necessary, and tailings are also being put down in quantities. The Tondong. S. Ikan, and Jugan roads are impassable. Bidi road is in excellent condition. It is doubtful if the S. Ikan and Jugan roads are Worth keeping up. Mr. K. H. Digby completed his work in con nection with mining syndicates, and returned to Kuching. His report has been submitted. The output of gold for January from Upper Sarawak mines was 1,924.125 ozs. as against 2,133.66 ozs. for December. The following table shows the individual output of gold from the various mines for the month of February : � The District Officer, Serian and Samaharan. reports that an enquiry was held concerning various defamatory statements made in Simunjan by a Malay named Tuanku Raja about the late Court Writer. Lai Ted Fah. The minutes were forwarded to the Resident. On 19th there was an attempted murder at Sebandi, Kuala Samarahan. Mr. Kelly, Assistant Commissioner of Constabulary, arrived and arrested the assailant named Ah Poh, and Lai Khiew, the victim, was taken to Kuching hospital in a critical state, having parting wounds al lover the upper part of his body. Penghulu Giang's cousin applied for permission for himself and four doors of Batang Rejang Dayaks to settle at Temiang, Ulu Simunjan. Permission was granted to Giang's cousin to return to Simunjan. as he originally used to live at Temiang. but the other four doors were refused since immingration of Sea Dayaks from other divisions into the Sadong and Samarahan districts is forbidden. Tuai Rumah Mangki of Ulu Simunjan applied to farm on the true left hand bank of the Gedong. Permission was refused as the Gedong river is the boundary between the Sea Dayaks and Melikins. The District Officer, Serian. states that when he arrived at Kampong Entengan, S. Tuang, Sama rahan, on February 28th the Dayaks were in a great state of excitement as a woman had died at 12 noon the day before, and had come to life again at 4 p.m. She died a second time at 3 a.m. and the body was washed and laid out, and was being carried outside when she again camp to life at 4 a.m. She was still alive, though with very high fever, when the District Officer saw her at 2 p.m. on the 28th. She had some very wonderful stories about the next world, and told bow she had met her grandparents, who would not receive her, and who told her tn return to life. Rhe was given a stimulant, and when the District Officer left her she was still able to walk. The lower Sanmarahan padi is not as good as that in the rest of the district owing to the ravages of bengas. All have been busy gathering the harvest. The Senior Agricultural Officer visited Simunjan on 8th is connection with the demarcation of the T. Bluku. which may later be turned into an experi mental padi farm. A Japanese expert on padi planting arrived at Siniawan during the month, and Messrs. Nissa Shokai & Co. have experimentally planted out various kinds of padi-seeds from Java and Formosa. It is understood that the soil at Samarahan was very well reported on. This year the Japanese have had seven buffaloes working, and the padi is looking good. When finally all tree stumps have been uprooted, the Nissa Shokai padi farm should be an example to the natives. At present there is a shortage of water there, but reservoirs are being made. Work on the new Serian shophouses, which are of standard design, continues, and four new applications for sites have been received. On February 27th news was received from Kuching that two prisoners, Nordin and Jasman, had escaped, and were probably making for Tebe kang and the border. On the name day patrols were sent out from Serian and both prisoners were arrested at Pengkallan Krosen on the 29th and sent back to Kuching under escort. This is the third time that escaped prisoners have been caught on this Pengkallan, the last one being Ex-Sergeant-Major Sulong. It appears that after reaching the 27th mile they cut up to P. Bentang, Munggu Babi. Pichin, and, missing Tebekang, cross the river at Krosen and then go along the main track to the frontier. It ia also a favourite route for both Chinese and Malays who wish to enter Sarawak from Dutch territory without passes, and only a few months ago two Chinese and two Dayaks were arrested while making for Pengkallan Bentang. All shops along the const were examined for over storage of rubber and trading without licences, and at Kampong Pinang, Samarahan, one Chinese was found with an excess of six piculs. The rubber was taken to Nanga Tuang and burnt and a summons issued. In the Endap, one Chinese was found trading without a licence; he is the mandor of Ong Ewe Hai�s Rubber Estate. A summon was issued and the rubber (66 sheets) was confiscated. A report was received that the Nissa Shokai Estate had planted new rubber. I saw the manager on 29th and he said that he gave orders for the jungle to be cleared to enable the coolies to pass from one section of the estate tn another easily, and that while he was away in Kuching for seven days Mr. Hatabe gave orders to the coolies to plant 2,830 new trees. Action will have to be taken against the Estate as the natives are watching eagerly to see if the offence is going to he compounded. Below are extracts from a report by Mr. E. H. Elam, District Officer, Serian and Samarahan, on a visit to Simunjan : - "I visited Simunjan from February 8th to 20th, during which time the Senior Agricultural Officer arrived, and also the Auditor. I left Simunjan on the 21st with the Auditor and spent the night at Semrah, and next day went to Kuching. I returned to Sambir with the Secretary for Native Affairs on the 25th, and then visited every village in the Samarahan and Tilling rivers except Rembus and Embang; in every one the new tuba-fishing Order was explained. The Malays of Tembirat, Bahru and Bondong have built very good kampong roads, a great improvement since my last visit in November. I am not, however, satisfied with Sea and Sebuyow Dayak affairs in the ulu Samarahan, aud have instructed the Native Officer to visit the villages regularly and see if he can settle the district. At present Saribas Dayaks are having their cases tried by a Sebuyow Dayak. A plan for the development of M. Tuang was laid out and forwarded to five Resident, but the whole scheme will fall to the ground if it is found that Haji Jera-ee owns, as he claims, all the land beside the Native Officer�s quarters up the banks of the river. Recent tracings of the area from the Land and Survey Department, however, show a space of forty fathoms of non-alicnatcd land between the edge of Haji Jera-ee�s land and the river bank. "Native Officer Abang Samsudin visited the ulu Gedong from 21st to 28th after having been to Lobang Batu to supervise the collection of the birdsnests." Cambridge Local Examinations. ST.

A rugger match was arranged, at very short notice, to take place in Kuching on the evening of Hari Raya Haji, and the response was excellent. The teams which took the field were as follows :� Saleh changed sides at half time from Colours to Whites. Referee.-W. H. Kelley. The game started at a very fast pace which, as might be expected, was not maintained in the second half. Colours missed many opportunities of scoring in the first half when they were getting the ball out from almost every scrum, but managed to score three unconverted tries. One of these tries was scored by Saleh with a very clever run ending between the posts. Saleh showed himself throughout the game to be a very promising player, and his swerve would be the envy of many first-class players at home. In the second half Stephen Harry, playing wing three-quarter, broke away and ran strongly to score Whites� only try. We hope that many more Malays will he encouraged to play with us in the future. Noakes again showed us all how rugger should be played, and was the outstanding player throughout the game. Griffin, for Colours, ran very strongly on the wing and was always dangerous. The tackling was very disappointing when com pared with the game played at the end of December. Possibly the hesitation in "going low" was due to the fact that bools were worn and not gym shoes, as before. Our thanks are due to Mr. W. H. Kelley for lending the Police Ground for the game, and also for filling the post of referee. He coined out this duty really well and, by overlooking small faults due to inexperience or lack of practice, kept the game going with a minimum of stoppages. There were no free kicks awarded to either side. The game, which was played for rather more than ten minutes each way, resulted in a win for Colours by 9 points to 3, and was so enjoyable that it is hoped that a few more practices may be arranged before Race Week, when possibly two teams of fifteen may be raised. The third rugger match of the season took place on Saturday, 14th March, at the Police Padang, Badrudin Road. Heavy rain during the afternoon had reduced the pitch to a quagmire, and combined back play was al a discount. It was an ideal day for the rushing tearaway type of forward, who however, is mainly conspicuous in Kuching by his absence. Great keenness was shewn by the Malays in this match and no less than fifteen Asiatics turned out, enabling the sides to take the field at full strength. Our thanks are due to all those who showed keen ness enough to turn out, and we hope enthusiasm for the game will wax and not wane as time goes on. As a matter of fact, it is somewhat doubtful whether it is wise at the moment to include at the same time so many men who are strange to the game. The real rugger man who knows the game, and whose example might with advantage be followed by the beginner, is apt to be swamped in the keen but unskilful rushings and jostlings of the newcomers. Sides of five forwards and three three quarters might prove better as a medium of instruc tion for those new to the Rugby code. Of the game itself little need be said. It was not a game of outstanding incidents, honest endeavour was too often baulked by a sodden ground or a slippery ball, or even, as one member of the Colours XV found to his cost and probably to his great surprise, by a determined and tenacious tackle by a member of his own side. Whites won three minutes from time, Whale scoring the only try of the match. Of the backs Henson for the Colours and Griffin for the Whites both shewed good form, but the defence was generally on top. Durrant placed a determined game ut forward for the winners and both packs stuck to their work well. W. J. Chater shewed keenness for the Colours and seemed in better training than most. Mr. A. G. Taylor very ably led the Colours� scrum. The complete lack of knowledge of the off-side rule shewn by most of the forwards, and the dis covery now arid then of a wing three-quarter in the midst of a set scrum, only added to the gaiety of things, and one must congratulate Mr. Kitto, the referee, for his tactful and altogether satisfactory handling of the game. The afternoon closed with a demonstration by the crowd in the stand who. unlike most of the players, seemed to consider that the second half was unduly short. A claim for the return of gate-money, how ever, was firmly refused.�Contributed. Club News. Sarawak Club. HANDICAP BOWLS COMPETITION: February, 1936. Tennis. Mixed Doubles Championship Final.�Mrs. Pitt Hardacre and Mitchell beat Mrs. Kelley and Kitto 6-4, 6-1. The first set was very even, but in the second set, Mitchell, who was serving and volleying really well, carried all before him. Mrs. Pitt-Hardacre also played a very sure game, making very few mistakes. Don�t be downhearted Mrs. Kelley! Next time perhaps you will have a partner who docs not "poach" so much. Now that the long-drawn-out season has come to au end. we should like to compliment all the mems on their vastly improved play. Mrs. Calvert, for example, is now placing at least +30 bettor than she was six months ago. A thing the meins should attempt, though, is to go up to the nct and indulge in a little volleying. All that is needed is courage, and then they will find the game much more enjoyable. To begin with, just go and stand about four feet behind the net when your partner is serving. The stroke required can be learnt in the privacy of one�s home and only three things are required: a small frying pan, a chair and your husband. Having obtained there three essentials, order your husband to sit on the chair and then stand in front of him about lour feet away. Hold the frying pan nearly vertical by grasping the handle with one hand, and assume a slightly crouching position as though about to spring forward. Resist this temptation, however, and merely push the frying pan smartly into his face. Now, when executing the push volley at tennis, you go through exactly the same action. What could be simpler? Just try it and see. Also remember that the psychological effect of a mem smiling over the net is enough to put most poor susceptible bachelors off their game straight away. �(Contributed.)

Badminton parties or clubs may affiliate with the K.B.A. by paying a yearly affiliation fee of $3. Badminton is a game which is already very popular in Kuching, but we think the time has now come to co-ordinate the activities of the various small clubs by the formation of the Kuching Badminton Association. A programme of friendly games is being arranged and. to start off with, the Sarawak Club and the Chinese Clubs are inviting members of some of the Malay kampong clubs to their courts. We hope to make these friendly games one of the chief objects of the Association. The Hon.

On February 3rd, four Spak Dayaks were sentenced in the Resident�s Court, Simanggang, to six months� rigorous imprisonment for harbouring Kayan and Jeluieng, two outlaws who arc wanted for murder. An inquest was held by Native Officer Abang Morni on Taw anak Adeng, of Rumah Kula, Banting, who was drowned at Stogo, Lingga, on February 7th. A verdict of suicide during tempo rary insanity caused by excessive indulgence in alcohol was returned. Two hundred and thirty-eight out-patients were treated at Simanggang Government Dispensary during the month, and 189 N.A.B. injections were administered. On the 13th, six Dayaks from the Skrang obtained passes to move to Temburong, in Brunei territory. They were the advance guard of the main party of nine doors. On the 12th, Tuai Rumah Sait reported that the preliminary clearing of the experimental demon stration vegetable garden at ?nteban had been completed. A temporary building had also been erected. A Chinese vegetable gardener was sent to Entebau with an Inspector from the Agricultural Department to prepare seed-beds, etc. Seeds and cuttings will be sent up early in March. Harvesting is in progress in most parts of the Simunggang district, and good crops are reported, except from Dan and certain areas of the Sebuyow, where rats and empangau have earned some damage. Harvesting has been completed in the Ulu Lingga and the Ulu Sebuyow, where very heavy crops are reported. On the 12th, Tuai Rumah Grang, of Nanga Matu, Ulu Lemanak, reported that his house of eleven doors had been totally destroyed by fire. Apparently the fire was accidentally caused by a woman named Seda. Padi crops in the Engkilili district appear to be excellent, much to the relief of the natives, who have undergone considerable hardship as a result of the failure of the harvest last year. On February 3rd, a prisoner named Ginda escaped from Engkilili Jail while his fellow-prisoners were preparing their morning meal. He was met at Pungkang by his mother, who sent him back to prison during the afternoon. On February 27th. Ts'ai Nyat Ted was elected Capitan China of Engkilili following a meeting hold in the Court. House and attended by nearly all the towkays of the station. Two hundred and twenty-three out-patients were treated at Betong Government Dispensary during the month, and ninety-two N.A.B. injections were administered. The general health of the district was good. Towards the end of the month three Tuai Rumah proceeded to Kuching to interview His Highness the Rajah and to plead for a remission of sentence for the Spak Tuai Rumah who were sentenced at Simanggang to six months� imprisonment for har bouring outlaws. Alternate heavy showers and bright sunshine have encouraged fanners to look forward to a good harvest in the Saribas district. Harvesting of swamp padi has started in the Pusa and Debak districts; Belong, where planting was not seriously begun until November, has less favourable pros pects. Reports on hill padi continue to be very satisfactory. Towards the end of the month, thirty-five Dayaks under Chendang, of Rumah Penghuhi Ramba, Nanga Mujan, and Dabong, of Rumah Saran Tarum Buai, Engkari, started for Nanga Kanowit to work for Air. Kidd on Tanah Estate, Ltd. They all went overland, the Batang Ai party by way of Ulu Lelap arid Lumut, and the Engkari by the Lanja, and so down the Kanowit. It was agreed that whichever party arrived first would wait the other at Nanga Meluan. A claim against Bungkong (Tuai Rumah of Lobang Baya) for kandong was made by one of his own anakbiak during the month. Since the actual kandong occurred some six or seven years ago during Bungkong's absence in Perak. and since no claim has been made until now, it is generally considered that the girl and her supporters will have their work cut out to carry the matter through, especially as the girl's parents made the mistake of killing the lenian Mure making the claim. The whole case was brought up out of spite caused by dis satisfaction nt the distribution made by Bungkong of his reward for the capture of Bala and Bidat, the Song murderers, last year. Ulu Dayaks are now busy harvesting. and a start has been made in the Lubok Antu neighbourhood. The padi crop in general is good this year, though the peoplc living between Nanga Engkari and Nanga Delok are again in for a bad time. Reports from the Delok are not very good. The District Officer, Lubok Antu, submits the following report on a trip up river in search of Dayak outlaws :- "On February 6th, I sent N.O. Abang Abu Talip and twelve constables oil up river, and started myself the next day. By making use of the outboard (which unexpectedly did not break down) as far as Krangan Mong, I reached Nanga Musing the first day, and Rumah Abong at Krangan Tibu (Nanga Lobang Baya) on the next. The following day I went up to Nanga Mujan, and engaged three Dayaks as guides for the Ulu Ai patrol. I put Abang Abu Talip in charge of the Mujan, and ordered L.-C. Mawar at Nanga Tiga to patrol the Gaong, Menamong, Supa and Sungei Barik, and to watch the road from the Dutch Border. 1 myself took on the Ulu Batang Ai, and made my chief langkau at Lempa, but soon moved on to a spot between N. Teliang and N. Kaup from where it was easy to watch the border. There were no signs of the outlaws, nor of the Dutch troops on the border, though the latter had started about a fortnight before I had. I returned to Lubok Antu on 25th but left Abang to do a final round of the Ulu Ai. The land in the Ulu Ai is excellent for padi, or any other crops. The river above the Lempa has no wong or grugu; there are quite large pieces of empran, and the hills are only gently sloping, very different indeed from the Batang Ai country lower down. The land was formerly farmed by the ancient 'Ulu Ai' of whose descendants (so I am told) there are none left in this river, but it appears that the Baleh, Gat and some of the Katibas people are descended from them. Third Division News. FEBRUARY. Thirty-three civil and fifty-two criminal cases came before the Sibu Courts during the month. Requests from Chinese to open small vegetable gardens in the temuda in compartment 3 of Bukit Lima Forest reserve were taken advantage of, and two small taungya plots were laid out adjoining the original experimental plot planted in 1932. Each plot is about one acre in area, and will be treated in the same manner as the original plot. On February 27th the Divisional Forest Officer left for Kapit in M.L. Chamois with the District Officer, Kapit, to continue, and if possible complete, the boundary survey of the Pelagus reserve. Work on the foundations of the New Sibu Hospital continued. By the end of the month 618 bakan 26' piles had been driven into position. On February 5th a quantity of decomposed fish was found exposed for sale in Sibu fish market. This was seized and destroyed, and those responsible were warned that should this happen again, they will be prosecuted. The Chief Justice and the Principal Medical Officer arrived at Sibu in H.H.M.Y. Maimuna on February 18th. The Chief Justice proceeded the same day to the Fourth Division, and called at Sibu on the 26th on his return to Kuching. The Principal Medical Officer returned to Kuching on the 20th. At the beginning of the month the bazaar was crowded with levies from the blockhouses in the Kanowit area, who were being paid off since the garrisons of these blockhouses are being disbanded Several meetings of the Sibu Rent Restriction Committee were held during the month to examine the question of increased rents claimed by landlords on the grounds of increased prosperity. After due consideration it was agreed that in certain cases rents should be raised. An appeal to the Supreme Court from the Resi dent's Court case in which Chop Yong Kee, of Binatang, was convicted of smuggling matches, was heard by the Chief Justice at Sarikei. The judg ment of the Resident�s Court was upheld, but the sentence was reduced to a fine of $1,000. At Matu a well-to-do Haji was fined $250 for illicit planting of rubber. During February one inquest was held nt Binatang on the body of a Chinese cooly working for one of the sago factories, who was found hanging from a beam in the factory cooly-lines. A verdict of suicide was returned. At Matu a Foochow was drowned when he slipped off the bridge over the river opposite the Kubu in the early hours of the morning. Rescue work was apparently delayed, and further enquiries are being instituted by the Officer-in-Charge. Matu. Except for one case of breach of trust, there was no serious crime in the Lower Rejang district during the month. The Principal Medical Officer and the Government Dentist paid a short visit to Sarikei on February 18th. The District Officer, Lower Rejang, reports that large numbers of Dayaks continue to come to buy cartridges. A wandering Kampar Dayak was brought in by some Julau Dayaks, as he could give no satisfactory account of himself. He was duly sent up to Sibu. The Dayaks are to he commended for this action as it is proof their desire to assist Government in rounding up the outlaws. It is anticipated that the recent drought will have seriously affected the chances of a good padi crop in the bills of the Lower Rejang District, but as yet there have been no reports to this effect Seeds were received from Kuching and an experimental vegetable garden is now laid out and planted clone to the Sarikei office, It is hoped that the first crop of vegetables will be ready for con sumption in about six week's time. Work on the Sarikei wharf was finished early in the month, and the wharf was once again opened to vessels of all sizes on February 10th. Mooring facilities are still inadequate, and the long breast hawsers attached to the shore bollards, together with the spring ropes. are continually breaking and giving trouble. The Binatang godown is nearing completion. Contracts for earth filling to the floor and for making paths to the godown are in hand. Abang Openg. Native Officer, visited the Dayaks in the ulu Sarikei on February 8th and 9th. Abang Otton. Native Officer of Binatang. toured the Dayaks in the District of the new Penghulu Kana, who has taken over a share of Penghulu Ikan's district below Leba�an, from Ilie 1st to 13th. Police and village constables were on tour through out the whole district during the Tapping Holiday. Schooner Soon Ann of 54 tons called in at Matu on the 18th and cleared on the 21sL This is the first large schooner to enter the river since 1933. As a contrast to last month, the weather on the coast was particularly mild. The District Officer, Lower Rejang, spent a whole day and night at Tanjong Sirik examining the area which it is necessary to clear round the light-house. The land has made tremendous at this point; in 1923 the light-house used to be on the verge of the sea, but it is now about a mile inland on the western side, and two-thuds of a mile inland on the northern side. The tapping holiday again proved a success, since there was only one small ease of illegal tapping in the whole Lower Rejang District. This occurred at Matu, where a Melanau gave as his excuse that he had misunderstood the dale. A small fine was imposed. Relief work was given to mine indigent Chinese coolies during the holiday. They were employed on, making u path through the gardens from the Nyelong river at Sarikei towards Binatang. A distance of some 3 1/2 miles was covered, and quite a good path now exends almost as far as Sungei Selidap. This is a very useful piece of work, as the path follows the telephone rentis and will thus considerably decrease the cost of upkeep of this rentis, while it is also on the direct line to Binatang. Street lighting was supplied in Binatang from the first of the month by the Sarawak Electricity Supply Company. A number of shophouses have also had electno light installed. The light is not very good, owing to the low power of the engine in the plant, but the benefit is considerable in a station which pre viously boasted no street lamps at all. Government quarters have been wired up. but contact points have not yet been installed. At Matu Her Highness the Ranee's birthday was celebrated by the opening of the "Abang Subah" school, a new Malay School in Kampong Bawang. Attendances promise to be good and the school should proven a success. Only two criminal cases came before the Kapit courts during the month, both cases of petty theft involving the same accused; sentences totalling six months were imposed. No civil cases were heard during the month, and no serious crime came to light. The District Officer, Kapit, reports than on February 17th Abang Indeh, Native Officer, returned from Woh Padang and ulu Katibas having patrolled the area farmed by the outlaws and destroyed everything be could find. No news has yet been heard of Penghulu Grinang's expedition up the ulu Gat. Propaganda work is still being carried out in Kapit district regarding the approaching prohibition of tuba fishing; unfortunately dissatisfaction is still felt in some places, but every effort will be made to remove this feeling. Most of the Dayaks realize that prohibition has to come. Harvesting is now in full swing. Although crops are good in Some districts, the general harvest is only moderate. The Katibas padi is reported to have suffered very severely from rats and birds. Four hundred and thirty-seven logs were rafted to Sibu by Chop Lee Hua during February. Twenty one logs remained at Kapit at the end of the month. The District Officer, Oya and Dalat, reports that all has been quiet in the Ulu. Dayaks have been busy on their farms. Reports on the padi crop during the month have not been so good as previously. A good harvest is hoped for, but rats, pigs and empanngau have been causing considerable damage. The weather on the coast has generally speaking been fine, and fishing has been in full swing, but the catches have not been good. The price of raw sago increased slightly on the figures for Iast month, the price per passu at Dalat being 50 cents, and at the Kut 55 cents. The amount of raw sago exported from the Oya District increased slightly as compared with last month, the figures being :- In collaboration with the District Officer, Mukah, the Penat-Judan road was inspected and also the bridges across these two rivers on February 11th. The Penat bridge is undergoing repairs, and the road from Penat to Judan has been re-made further inland away from the sea and running in a straight line beside the telephone poles. Permission was received by the Committee of the Chin Hua School, Dalat, to collect subscriptions up to $1,000 for the completion of the school. Work on the school is in progress and subscriptions arc coming in. Police patrols visited every part of the Oya District throughout the tapping holiday, and no cases of illicit tapping were brought to light. On February 10th, two Village Constables were stationed half way between Kampong Kekan and Kampong Kut to count the number of boats which traversed the Kut during twenty-four hours. It was found that sixty boats laden with sago proceeded from Dalat to Kampong Kut, and that thirty-one boats laden with various merchandise proceeded from Kampong Kut to Dalat. The water in the Kut was very low on this occasion, but in spite of this the volume of traffic indicates that this channel of communication is of great importance to the district. The District Officer, Mukah, reports that no further action has been taken in the Judan robbery case, though inquiries as to where the stolen goods were disposed of are still proceeding. Local searchers have revealed nothing. No other crime was reported in the Mukah district during the month. It has been decided to hold a monthly meeting of all Tua-tua kampong in order to discuss current affairs, principally land and sago. Efforts have been made to induce sorne natives to ship sago to the Kut where they obtain a much better price for their product, but they seem strangely unwilling to escape from the clutches of local money-lenders. A notice was posted at Mukah reminding the native population of the previsions of Order No. 24 of 1915 which states that all Likos who adopt the Mohammedan faith should make a will, or a deed, for the protection of their children, who, in accor dance with the Mohammedan uudang undang, stand to lose all their inheritance in these cases. Thirty-two vessels totalling 1,067 tons cleared from Mukah during February. Island Club Grand National Sweepstake 1936. THE DRAW. Fourth Division News. FEBRUARY. In the Resident�s Court at Miri two Sibuti Chinese were lined $300 each for an impudent attempt to obtain money by falsifying their books. This case arose out of an appeal from a decision in the Miri Court of Small causes. During the hearing of this appeal (which was upheld) the fraud was discovered. One of the Sarawak Oilfields, Ltd., clerks was sentenced at Miri to two terms of imprisonment of 18 months each for breach of trust and falsification of books. The Resident, Fourth Division, left Miri on Feb ruary 18th for a tour in the old Fifth Division, returning on the 28th. During the course of this tour he visited Limbang, Lawas, Trusan, Sundar, Brooketon. Brunei and Labuan. Nothing of much importance was brought forward except the difficulty of keeping up Government roads, grounds and buildings on the reduced votes. Limbang Bazaar appeared to be flourishing and full of people and goods, and Lawas Bazaar has built a substantial school. Lawas and Limbang rubber estates are doing well. The District Officer, Limbang and Lawas. reports that Court work was exceedingly light during the month, and no crime of any importance was reported or detected in his district. Very few Dayaks or up-river natives visited Limbang during February, being all busy with their padi-harvests. Reaping was in full swing in both hill and swamp land by the end of the month. The pepper crop was ripening by the end of February and appeared satisfactory, hut it is yet too early to predict the quantity that will be collected. The tapping holiday was conscientiously observed throughout the Limbang district, and only one breach of regulations was detected. This was com mitted by a Tua Kampong who should have known better, and who was consequently severely dealt with. Except for a small quantity from Limbang Estate, no rubber was exported from Limbang during the last two weeks of the month. The carpentcr, some prisoners, and the crew of the launch were busy for about two weeks on the thorough overhaul, repairs aud repainting of m.l. Sylvia. M.L. .Sylvia was put on the slipway for this period. The top main dam at Bukit Hitam, Limbang, ran dry during the month, so advantage was taken of this to clean it out. The lower dam was utilized; this contains excellent water, but has not sufficient gravity to give much pressure. Advantage was taken of the dry weather to patch up some of the worst places on the Panderuan and Berawan roads. Mr. J. R. Outram, Cadet, accompanied by up river Agent Jaya, and Penghulu Wee, left on Feb ruary 4th on a visit to all houses in the Panderuan and Berawan. returning to Limbang on 9th. A drought was experienced throughout the month at Limbang. a total of only 2.53 inches of rain being recorded. This was made up of small showers at night, and these only occurred on six occasions. Penghulu Manggoi of the Niah came down to Miri during the month and reported all well in his district. T.K. Pejaweng (Penan) of Ulu Niah reported that his house had been burnt down while he was away working damar. T.K. Sugon (Penan) of S. Sawai, Ulu Suai, reported an inferior crop of Penan padi this season. Pests include ulat and belalang, kera and rats. Alterations are continuing to the new Gambling Farm premises at Miri, aud it is hoped to open this building in the near future. Mr. D. V. Murphy, Assistant Commissioner, Sarawak Constabulary, relieved Mr. W. L. P. Sochon, Officer Commanding Miri Constabulary Sector, on the latter's transfer to Sibu. H.H.M.Y. Maimuna arrived at Miri from Lim bang during the month and was reported to have damaged plates in her bottom. An inspection was made and the vessel was able to continue her journey to Kuching. The District Officer, Miri, paid a routine visit to Niah and Sibuti districts from the 10th to 15th, when all books and cash were checked and outstand ing matters settled. Almost continual rain is reported from Sibuti, but Miri district as a whole enjoyed a spell of fair weather during February, rain being noticeable by its absence. The Assistant District Officer, Lawas and Trusan, reports that all natives are away on their farms. The padi crops in the Lawas and Merapok rivers are reported to be good, but those in Trusan have suffered a good deal from pests. The Lawas (Sarawak) Estates, Limited, exported 36,260 lbs dry rubber during the month. The number of pupils attending the Chung Hua School, Lawas, is now 34. They come from Trusan, Sundar, and Merapok, as well ns from Lawas. During the month two deaths, and one severe injury that may prove fatal, were caused by crocodiles at Baram. The actual facts are as yet uncertain as investigations are still in progress, but from the rather vague reports it appears that a Kenyah from Loug Ikan was taken whilst fishing in a small lake above the Tutoh, and an Iban whilst fishing in the Bakong. The remains of both bodies were recovered. A Kayan from Long Laput, also fishing in a small tributary of the Tru, was attacked, and a large part of his thigh removed. All three cases are being inquired into. Several parties of Kelabits have been down to Baram lately, selling tobacco, and asking assistance in auctioning rhinoceros horns. Their country has not been visited by a European officer for nearly four years, and it is unfortunate that the proposed trip next month has had to be cancelled. N.O. Mohamad Zin Galau, however, will start by way of the Apoh on the 10th, and it is hoped that, a European will he able to go. either towards the end of this year, or at the beginning of next. Galau has instructions to obtain the opinion of the various headmen concerning the proper person to replace the late Penghulu Tanma Abu Tingang. Mr. D. C. Hudden, District Officer, Barnin, sub mits the following report on a trip to the Ulu :� Accompanied by Native Officers Tuanku Mohamad and Galau I left Mairudi on January 17th to attend the three Penan meetings at Long Melinau. Long Akah and Lio Matu. The attendance at each place was poor, for the reason, it is felt, that a certain amount of surreptitious trading is still occurring. It would tend to assist matters if the same regulations for Penans were adopted in the Balui and Belaga as in this district. The inhabitants of the Tinjar, especially, are continually inquiring the reason that they themeelves are enforced to trade in the presence of a Government representative, whilst on the other side of the watershed, two days� walk al the most, there are no restrictions. "Galau was left at Long Linai on the 23rd, returning to Marudi on the 27th, and Tuanku Mohamad and myself proceeded up the Baram. At Long Lama several of the birdsnests� caves were inspected, and it was found that the mouths of all caves had been cleared of timber and brush wood for some considerable distance. The originator of this senseless innovation is of course unknown, but like sheep everyone has followed his example. The birds have gone deeper into the caves, to avoid the light and heat, and have buit in more inaccessible places, where they arc more likely to he preyed upon by bats. "At Long Akah Aban Wan handed in his flag and Aban Jau has agreed to assist by acting in his place, for the month or two that will be necessary before his successor is appointed. "Tuanku Mohamad left me on February 14th al Long Pawan, and returned to Marudi down the Baram. 1 walked across to the Tinjar. where Tuanku Taha was awaiting at Long Salai. Having visited all houses in the Tinjar we returned to Marudi on the 28th. "The journey took twelve days longer than was expected, portly owing to high water whilst going up the Baram; with an outboard motor it could have been done in half the time." The natives in the Baram District are now harvesting their crops but reports are not encourag ing. At the best, there will he just sufficient to last until next year. Even where crops were good, and normally there would have been a satisfactory harvest, half has been destroyed by rate and juice, and the usual insects. The number of rats has been phenomenal and unprecedented. The Rev. Father Feltbrugge paid a visit to Baram during the month. During his stay he visited the Dayaks in the Bakung, and returned direct to Miri. Work on the stumping of the Bintulu landing ground has made very satisfactory progress. It was always realised that this was an unknown quantity, but it is proving much more difficult than was originally thought, and work is retarded by the absence of any kind of stumping machinery. During February, an area of about thirty acres was practically clean-stumped, and removal of the stumps from the actual landing area was started. A detailed survey of the swampy area was earned out by Ah Poon. Overseer of the Public Works Department. Mr. D. L. Leach of the Survey Department was in the Bintulu iffilrict on and off throughout the month in connection with the trig. survey. I am told that Bukits Skalap, Bala, Nyabau and Sap have been cleared ready for the erection of trig. stations. The Sarawak Timber and Trading Company's campaign for logs has proved rather too much for their production capacity. The District officer. Bintulu. says that he saw ready in the Pandan abont 1,800 logs, and over 3,000 have already been received at the mill. This represents nearly one years requirements, and there is some anxiety whether these logs will not be ruined by pin-worm before they can be used. This is in contrast to last year, when the mill had frequently to be stopped on account of shortage of logs. CORRESPONDENCE [The Editor is not responsible for the opinions of correspondents.] BISHOP'S HOUSE, KUCHING, SARAWAK, 9th March, 1936. To 'The Editor of the Sarawak Gazette. SIR, I have to-day read in the Gazette the extract you have printed from the November number of the Borneo Chronicle under the heading of "Sold Into Slavery,� together with your comments thereon. Obviously, at such a distance�the Chronicle is published in England�I am not in a position to "edit� any matter other than that which is supplied from the diocese itself. The extract quoted is not mutter written by anyone at present working in Sarawak. However, I cannot but feel a responsibility, and I wish therefore, to hasten to express my deep regret that such statements should have been made by the writer of the extract in question. To take some comfort in observing, after a careful reading of the extract, that the writer is in fact referring to Chinese in general, and not specifically to the Chinese in Borneo. I am, indeed, certain that the writer, whatever inference may be drawn, did not wilfully inlend to give the impression, suggested by your third headline. The fact remains, however, that the last sentence quoted carries with it a more than unfortunate insinuation, that what may�I do not know�be true of certain parts of China, is true of the Chinese in Borneo. I can only repent my regret, and place on record, if I may, my conviction that the Government authorities would never for a moment knowingly countenance such habits. 1 beg to remain. Yours faithfully, NORL, Labuan & Sarawak. Kuching Market Price List. KUCHING MARKET PRICE LIST.�(Contd.)
